# Catch a feel~~

An 'i am learning solana' repository.

A feel is made up of somethings, which have an orientation in 3D space.

In effect, this is 3D scene compositions, stored on the solana blockchain.

For example, you can set the camera angle, you can even keyframe. 

In effect, this allows you make 2D such as text, images and 3D such as models live in the same space, and persisted forever via Solana's mechanisms. 

Each user can have one feel on record at any one time.

It is my hope that this could be used to allow 3d spatial communication.
